            <h1>Storyline</h1>
            <p>A story of refuge shows the sad reality of the sudden actions that happen with refugees when they have to leave their home. Through the different actions that appear suddenly, the refugees are put in a situation where they do not have the option but to run away from a village.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In our story, in the beginning after the introduction music is played, we hear a sound of dinner being prepared and a father calling his son to come down for dinner which shows that life was very ordinary and normal. Then out of nowhere someone knocks on the door intensely, when the father opens the door, his neighbor tells him that the village is being attacked and they need to leave.  Then an explosion takes a place in distance, and the father calls the son to leave. They start running towards the sea with the neighbor, with all of the war sounds in the background, and they get in on a boat to escape the war. Through the journey in the sea, the boat sinks, and a lot the refugees keep swimming. Just before they reach to the land, the son checks if his father is around, and the neighbor tells him that he did not make it. At the end a sad patriotic song is played, as closing that talks about how the homeland will be missed.</p>
