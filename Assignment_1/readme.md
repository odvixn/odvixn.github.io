# 30MFF Submission Webpage

## Project Description

The submitted video for 30MFF is my group's tribute to **Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride Month**, which began on June 1. Inheriting the idea, 30MFF Submission Webpage is meant to celebrate Pride Month by showcasing our video, explaining a brief history behind Pride Month, and suggesting ways to take part of Pride Month. In doing so, some design decisions are made, and those decisions are documented in a separate section.

## Design Decisions

Here is a list of design decisions and reasons behind them. Some decisions may be missing from the list.  
Overall, the designing of 30MFF Submission Webpage aims to be clear and straightforward.   
An original design is attached at the bottom, however, this list only considers the most up-to-date web design.  

- The format of 30MFF Submission Page is a one long webpage. It is partly to show that the webpage is devoted to a single particular topic, and a long-webpage format allows sections to divide into separate colors which then together creates a rainbow, a well-known symbol of the LGBTQ community.  
- The fixed navigation bar at the top is a complement to the long-webpage format. Since scrolling to navigate the webpage may sometimes be tiring, a navigation bar will always be present to help visitors navigate around the webpage with a single click. A smooth scrolling effect is added to the navigating feature so moving to a different section creates a rainbow.  
- The background color and font colors of the webpage are toned down to allow sentences to be read more comfortably.
- For section titles, an interactivity is introduced: when you place a cursor on one of these titles, the color of the title will change from black to a continuously-changing rainbow. This effect is a metaphor to a real-life person-to-person interaction where we may be prejudiced to think a particular color -or identity- of another person based on a short glance of what appears on the outside, while interacting with the person may surprise us with a range of colorfulness.  

## Process

- The model of 30MFF Submission Webpage is [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/). Following the model, the design of the webpage attempted to minimalize unnecessary elements by asking "why do I need this?" before each design process.  
- Parts such as the size of used fonts and spacings between elements were decided based on repeated offline experiments.  
- Having a navigation bar was not in the original plan, however, internal links and navigating features are added because each sections are distinct and it was becoming tiring to scroll up and down to during the above repeated experiments.  
- The building process itself was heavily based on looking up the Internet. Among the web, [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) became my best friends.  
- Browser-embeded Developer Tools are opened whenever something did not work as intended, which gave me a better idea on how things work. For example, Inspector showed which style is not applied to a desired element and Console, errors from executing JavaScript.  

## Reflection/Evaluation

Fortunately, my goal was to create a simple and straightforward webpage from the beginning. The idea continued, and there were not many changes made. The only noticeable changes are 1) an absence of the arrow from the first section to the next, 2) arrangements of the "By" section, and 3) an introduction of a navigation bar. The arrow was intended to let visitors know that there are more contents in the webpage other than 30MFF video, but this idea is absorbed by the navigation bar, which in addition provides the ease of page navigation. Arrangements of the "By" section is made to enhance the readability of its content.  

Although my opinion will change as I learn more about web building, the resulting webpage seems satisfactory for now. The only unsatisfactory part is that I spend too much time wandreing around the web searching for the ways to accomplish very basic things. Hopefully I have a better idea next time on what to do and where to look for.
